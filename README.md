# Time-series-Forcasting-Using-LSTM
This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict and forecast stock prices of a selected company (e.g., Tesla - TSLA) based on historical data. It aims to provide insights into potential future trends in stock prices, aiding investors and financial analysts in decision-making.

**Components:**
Data Acquisition and Exploration: Fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance and displays an overview of the data.

**Data Visualization:**
Generates visualizations of stock prices over time and plots training/testing sets.

**Data Preprocessing:**
Splits data into training/testing sets and scales it using MinMaxScaler.

**Model Building:**
Constructs and trains LSTM neural network model using Keras.

**Model Evaluation and Predictions:**
Evaluates model performance, makes predictions on testing data, and compares them with actual prices.

**Forecasting:**
Allows users to select a time period for future forecasting, generates forecasts using LSTM model, and displays them graphically.
